  ### Description
  In the course of this endeavor, I developed a web application/Discord bot that provides users with a convenient way to view the public Steam information of other users. The application allows users to grant access to their connected Steam account through a secure OAuth2 process, permitting others to use commands on their account as well. Use `/help` for further information.

  ### Usage
  Create a `.env` file.
  
  Add `REACT_APP_LOGIN_OAUTH_URL`, `REACT_APP_AUTH_OAUTH_URL`, and everything in `/src/config.ts` to the `.env` file.

  <br>

  `npm i` to install dependencies.

  `npm run build-client` to build the client.

  `npm run build-server` to build the server.

  `npm run push` to push to Github.
  
  `npm run dev` to run the bot with Nodemon.

  `npm run commands` to reload the commands.

  `npm run test` to run tests.
