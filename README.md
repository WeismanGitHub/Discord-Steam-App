  ### Description
  In the course of this endeavor, I developed a web application/Discord bot that provides users with a convenient way to view the Steam data of other users. The application allows users to grant access to their connected Steam account through a secure OAuth2 process, permitting others to view their Steam data right in Discord. Using slash commands, you can get a user's bans, friends, recent games, owned games, wishlist, and more with just a simple slash command. Additionally, there is a ticketing system, message board, and an admin dashboard website.

  On the back-end, this bot is built with Typescript and uses Express.js for the API. The front-end was created with React and JavaScript.

  *This bot can only display public information.
  ### Usage
  Create a `.env` file.
  
  Add `REACT_APP_LOGIN_OAUTH_URL`, `REACT_APP_AUTH_OAUTH_URL`, and everything in `/src/config.ts` to the `.env` file.
